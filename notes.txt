Introduction:
This application comprises of 2 components, Products Component and Cart Component and an Add-to-cart service. Each product has an id, Static display text, price,  product code and Image associated to it. Every product has an Add to Cart button which adds the product to the cart. An alert is generated every time a product has been added successfully to the cart. A dynamic text has been used using interpolation on the Cart button which displays the number of products available in the cart and a clear button has been provided to remove the items from the cart and make it empty.
In the cart component, the list of the products along with their individual price and a total price is implemented in a tabular format. A discounted price section has also been defined in the component which adds the total amount and displays it in the table. The user can navigate back to home page using the home button provided in the nav bar and add more products which will be added to the cart component. 

Implementation: 
An empty array has been initialised in the beginning of the code. Each time a product's Add to cart button is pressed, the relevant product id is pushed into the array which can be repetitive depending on the user's action. From this array, the frequency of the product occurring in the array is calculated which defines the count of each product in the cart. Based on this frequency, the code for a 3-for-2 discount is implement on each product where the price is discounted if the count for a product is 3. The total price is calculated based on this discount and displayed. The function for removing the product is also provided which removes a certain product in the cart and a new total is evaluated based on the same. 

The approach where only a single count of product can be removed has been left out which can be achieved using Incrementers which reduce or increase the frequency of a product in the cart.
